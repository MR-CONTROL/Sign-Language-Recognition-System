# Sign-Language-Recognition-System
This project uses MediaPipe and Scikit-Learn to recognize sign language through real-time hand landmark detection and Random Forest classification. It processes video with OpenCV for feature extraction, supports custom data via collect_data.py, and converts gestures into text and speech for inclusive, accessible communication.
